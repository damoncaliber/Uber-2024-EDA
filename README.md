# Introduction
Uber is a multinational ride-hailing and technology company that connects riders and drivers through its mobile platform. Founded in 2009 and headquartered in San Francisco, Uber has expanded its services to more than 10,000 cities across over 70 countries. Through the Uber app, users can request on-demand transportation, schedule rides, or access related services such as food delivery and freight logistics.

As of 2024, Uber remains one of the largest and most recognized mobility platforms in the world, completing billions of trips annually and supporting a global network of independent driver-partners. Its extensive data on ride patterns, cancellations, and customer behavior offers valuable insight into urban mobility trends and real-time transportation demand.

This project presents an exploratory data analysis of Uber ride data from 2024, uncovering key patterns in bookings, cancellations, and daily ride trends. Using Python as the primary language—alongside powerful libraries such as Pandas for data cleaning and manipulation, and Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization—the analysis highlights insights into rider behavior, peak demand periods, and operational efficiency across different days and months.

# Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to perform an in-depth exploratory data analysis of Uber’s 2024 ride dataset. Using Python and the Pandas library, the data was thoroughly cleaned and prepared to handle missing values, ensure accurate data types, and maintain overall quality. The analysis aims to uncover booking trends across different days, months, and times of day, as well as to investigate customer and driver cancellation behavior. Key findings are presented through clear visualizations created with Matplotlib and Seaborn, providing actionable insights into rider behavior, peak demand periods, and operational efficiency.

## Business Questions

1. What are the overall booking trends by day of the week and by month in 2024?

2. Which hours of the day experience the highest and lowest ride demand?

3. What are the most common reasons for customer and driver cancellations?

4. How do cancellations affect daily and monthly booking patterns?

5. Are there identifiable periods of peak demand that could guide driver allocation or promotional strategies?
